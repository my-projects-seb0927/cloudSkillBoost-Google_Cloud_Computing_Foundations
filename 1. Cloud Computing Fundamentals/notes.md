## Module 1: So, what's the cloud anyway?
### 1.1. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology that has five traits:
- Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.
- Customers get access to those resources over the internet.
- The provider of the resources allocates them to users out of that pool.
- The resources are elastic (They can increase or decrease as needed).
- Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go

### 1.2. Cloud vs. traditional architecture
#### History of Cloud Computing:
- **First wave:** Colocation (Physycal location)
- **Second wave:** Virtualized data center
- **Third wave:** Container-based architecture

### 1.3 IaaS, PaaS & SaaS
- **IaaS:** Infrastructure as a service.
It provides raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers.  (Pay for what they allocate).
- **PaaS:** Platform as a service.
It binds code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure applications need. (Pay what they use)
- **SaaS:** Software as a service.
SaaS applications are not installed on your local computer; they run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users

### 1.4 Google Cloud architecture

Google offers: Computing services, Storage services, Big data and ML product line.

## Module 2: Start with a solid platform

### 1. The Cloud Console
I can interact with the Google Cloud console by: Cloud Console, Cloud SKD and Cloud Shell, APIs and Mobile App.

### 2. Understanding projects
The Cloud console is used for accesing and using resources. Resources are organized in projects

Projects help to separate entities, hold resources for every Project, have different owners and users and Projects are billed separately.
Projects have:
- **ID** (unique)
- **Name** (Made by the user)
- **Number** (unique)

The Resource Manager manages Projects (Delete, Recover, Update, etc.)
Folders help to group resources.
